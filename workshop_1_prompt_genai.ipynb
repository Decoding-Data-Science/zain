You start with basic vocabulary, grammar rules, and eventually, you begin to understand the nuances of language by reading books, watching movies, listening to conversations, and interacting with native speakers. LLMs work in a similar way, but instead of learning from human interactions, they're trained on an enormous dataset of text from various sources.\n",
